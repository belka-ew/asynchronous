/**
 * Primitive lock objects.
 *
 * A primitive lock is a synchronization primitive that is not owned by a
 * particular coroutine when locked. A primitive lock is in one of two states,
 * ‘locked’ or ‘unlocked’.
 *
 * It is created in the unlocked state. It has two basic methods, $(D_PSYMBOL
 * acquire()) and $(D_PSYMBOL release()). When the state is unlocked,
 * $(D_PSYMBOL acquire()) changes the state to locked and returns immediately.
 * When the state is locked, $(D_PSYMBOL acquire()) blocks until a call to
 * $(D_PSYMBOL release()) in another coroutine changes it to unlocked, then the
 * $(D_PSYMBOL acquire()) call resets it to locked and returns. The $(D_PSYMBOL
 * release()) method should only be called in the locked state; it changes the
 * state to unlocked and returns immediately. If an attempt is made to release
 * an unlocked lock, an $(D_PSYMBOL Exception) will be thrown.
 *
 * When more than one coroutine is blocked in $(D_PSYMBOL acquire()) waiting for
 * the state to turn to unlocked, only one coroutine proceeds when a $(D_PSYMBOL
 * release()) call resets the state to unlocked; first coroutine which is
 * blocked in $(D_PSYMBOL acquire()) is being processed.
 *
 * $(D_PSYMBOL acquire()) is a coroutine.
 *
 * This class is not thread safe.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   lock = new Lock();
 *   ...
 *   lock.acquire();
 *   scope (exit) lock.release();
 *   ...
 *
 * Lock objects can be tested for locking state:
 *
 *   if (!lock.locked)
 *      lock.acquire();
 *   else;
 *      // lock is acquired
 *      ...
